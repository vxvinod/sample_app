Notes

 rails generate model User name:string email:string
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/[timestamp]_create_users.rb
      create    app/models/user.rb
      invoke    rspec
      create      spec/models/user_spec.rb


*bundle exec rake db:rollback --- executes drop table command
* annotate gem is used to create database schema in the model file in comment format.

Console 

User.new
User.create
user.destroy
user.reload
user.update_attributes



*bundle exec rake db:test:prepare ---------------- prepare test database

Presence Validation
The presence: true argument is a one-element options hash; recall from Section 4.3.4 that curly braces are optional when passing hashes as the final argument in a method

validates(:name, presence: true)

user.errors.full_messages----display error in console

validates :name,  presence: true, length: { maximum: 50 }  -----validates length of field

* user_with_same_email = @user.dup
      user_with_same_email.save	--------------
The method here is to make a user with the same email address as @user, which we accomplish using @user.dup, which creates a duplicate user with the same attributes. Since we then save that user, the original @user has an email address that already exists in the database, and hence should not be valid.				

*validates :email, presence: true, format: { with: VALID_EMAIL_REGEX },
                    uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }


checks case sensitive also
